# study-with-TRPL-2nd
This repository is supposed to store the contents created by the owner in studying Rust by following [The Rust Programming Language 2nd ed. (in Japanese)](https://doc.rust-jp.rs/book/second-edition/).

**`main.md` and most of the comments in the files are written in Japanese.**

## Requirements
Any environment which can run codes written in Rust.   
If users are new to Rust, I recommend the guide offered by [the Rust official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
